AltSpark (Local) processes content entirely on your device using Chrome built-in AI models (Prompt, LanguageDetector, Summarizer, Translator, Writer/Proofreader when available). The extension:

- Does not collect analytics or personal data.
- Does not send page content, selections, or generated suggestions to any server.
- Stores only your settings (enabled checks, preferred language) using Chrome storage sync/local for convenience.

Removing the extension or clearing Chrome storage deletes the stored settings.
